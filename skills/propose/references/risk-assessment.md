# Risk Assessment: SPEC-XXX

**Proposer:** [Agent]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Domains-Touched:** [per proposal]

## Risk Matrix

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| R-001 | [description] | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | [action] |

## What else could break

[What systems/teams/customers/regulators/revenue are affected if this change fails? Split by domain when multi-domain: engineering (services/data), finance (budget/controls), legal (exposure), marketing (brand/GTM), people (team/culture), revenue (pipeline/targets), automation/ops (runbooks/capacity).]

## Rollback Plan

[How to revert if issues arise — code revert AND non-code undo: retract comms, void filing, reverse close entry, disable workflow, with owner + ETA.]

## Security Considerations

[Auth, data exposure, input validation — security owner to confirm]

## Domain Considerations

[Finance: budget/controls — finance owner. Legal: IP/regulatory/liability — legal owner. Marketing: brand/GTM — marketing owner. People: workload/culture/change plan — people owner. Revenue: pipeline/quota — revenue owner. Automation/ops: runbook/capacity/flags — automation owner + engineering owner. Delete non-touched domains.]

## C2 budget note (REQ-002 — additive)

One-pass budget: a triggered challenge round runs exactly once, where pass
= ≤3 questions (question 4/N+1 = FAIL, blocked), then terminal
approve/reject; approver-requested re-grill ≤1 extra pass (total ≤2), then
Retry N=2 → escalate orchestrator. Exit before decision = pause + recorded
`grill: exited` + escalate, proposal stays unapproved. Blast-radius trigger
pointer: any blast-radius line mentioning customers/regulators/revenue (with
synonyms: users/clients/members/consumers, GDPR/Ley 172-13 (Dominican privacy law)/authorities,
pipeline/quota/money) fires the C2 round — independent scan rule applies
even when prose says "internal only". Rollback/approve-reject terminal preserved — the round challenges
the plan, it never rewrites it. Glossary single source C1 (`skills/agree-the-goal/SKILL.md` §C1); canonical clauses single source people SPEC §4.
