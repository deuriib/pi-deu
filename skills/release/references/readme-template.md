## Release-Time README Maintenance Checklist

During `release`, verify and execute the following updates on `README.md`:

1. **Version Pinning & Badges:**
   - [ ] Update version badge: `badge/version-vX.Y.Z-blue.svg`.
   - [ ] Update git installation pins: `#vX.Y.Z` in all clone/plugin snippets.
   - [ ] Release page link (`releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`): **optional** — a GitHub *Release* page is a separate object from the git tag that `release` step 8 creates. Use the tree link (`tree/vX.Y.Z`) unless a Release was published; if a Release is published, `gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes-file docs/specs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES.md`. Do not point at a `releases/tag/` URL that nothing created — `documentation-checklist.md` treats dead links as a gate violation.
2. **Feature Synchronization:**
   - [ ] Ensure newly shipped features from `RELEASE_NOTES.md` are reflected in Key Features.
   - [ ] Remove or update any deprecated capabilities or altered command flags.
3. **Quickstart Verification:**
   - [ ] Copy-paste and execute the quickstart instructions in a fresh workspace or container.
   - [ ] Verify that all cited paths, file names, and output markers match current behavior.
4. **Documentation Links:**
   - [ ] Verify that all markdown links in the Documentation Index resolve correctly.
